/*
Access and modify the structure of a tree of synths, with their busses and groups.  
Each node of the tree holds a synth, and if present, the group, and input-output
control names and busses.

Each server has one root SynthTree, whose root branch contains the RootNode.
There is one global root tree, that holds the root trees of all servers. 

For more, see separate doc.
