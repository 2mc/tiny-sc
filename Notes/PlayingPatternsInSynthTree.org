* Motivation / Goals

You want to play a pattern in a SynthTree.  Pbind-like.

Why re-invent the wheel:

- Make it easy to change parts of a pattern (patterns that play individual parameters in the pattern).  This is already possible in dewDrop lib and in JITLib, but it is even easier in PatternPlayer.
- Make it possible to play the same pattern in different synthtrees, with different synths/instruments, at the same time.

* Scenario / Basic principles

Start with a pattern as an array of streams, where each stream produces values to for one parameter of an instrument.   The array of collected values is used as =args= to create a synth with =Synth(instrument, args, target, addAction)=.  (But it can easily be used for triggering other types of events, alternatively or additionally).

In addition to the array of streams, two more items of information are needed to play the pattern:

1. The stream of durations separating each successive event of the pattern (i.e. the timing of the events of the pattern).
2. The stream of instruments (synthdef names or possibly other types of objects) used to play each successive event.

Pbind incorporates the duration and the instrument stream in the parameter array.  PatternPlayer separates these two, for ease of handling.  Separating durations makes it easier to code the Function of the Task that plays the pattern.   Separating the instrument makes it possible to play the same stream of parameters with different instruments.

* Class overview
PatternPlayer is put inside a PatternInstrument.

The PatternInstrument is the template for playing.

It produces a PatternSynth, which becomes the synth inside the SynthTree.

Other classes are:

SynthPattern
SynthStream
ParamStream
SynthEvent

* Architecture



* Coding the creation and playing of Patterns

A simple way to create and play a pattern is through a chain of binary operations, where each successive operation adds a component to create the final pattern object that is played in the SynthTree.  The final object is of class PatternInstrument, and contains the parameter array, the duration stream and the instrument stream.   The steps in creating a PatternInstrument are:

1. Start with an array of key-pattern pairs:
   =~params = [freq: 440, amp: Prand([1, 2], inf)]=
2. Add the duration stream to create a PatternPlayer:
   =~player = ~params %> Pseq([0.1, 0.1, 0.2],inf );=
3. Add the instrument stream to create a PatternInstrument:
   =~patternInstrument = ~player %> \default;=
4. Finally, chuck the PatternInstrument into a SynthTree to play it:
   =~patternInstrument => \sound_pattern1=

This can be written in one chain of operations, without storing the intermediate objects in variables:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[freq: 440, amp: Prand([1, 2], inf)]
=> Pseq([0.1, 0.1, 0.2],inf )
=> `\default
=> \sound_pattern1;
#+END_EXAMPLE

If the instrument is \default, it can be skipped:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[freq: 440, amp: Prand([1, 2], inf)]
=> Pseq([0.1, 0.1, 0.2],inf )
=> \sound_pattern1;
#+END_EXAMPLE

But also the durations, or both durations and duration can be skipped.  Defaults are provided:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[freq: 440, amp: Prand([1, 2], inf)]
=> `\default
=> \sound_pattern1;
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[freq: 440, amp: Prand([1, 2], inf)]
=> \sound_pattern1;
#+END_EXAMPLE

To indicate that a pattern is intendet for instrument and not durations, use the adverb 'i':

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[freq: 440, amp: Prand([1, 2], inf)]
=>.i [\pad, \fm].prand
=> \sound_pattern1;
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Pattern =>

Pattern => (something) creates a PatternPlayer, with a single pattern.  This is for playing in a single argument of a SynthTree (not a pattern array to create events in a SynthTree).

- Pattern => num :: PatternPlayer (single pattern!)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
// start sound
{ SinOsc.ar(\freq.kr(440)) } => \sound;
// play pattern 1 into frequency
Prand([60, 62, 63, 64, 67].midicps, inf) => 0.1 => ~freq;
#+END_EXAMPLE

- Pattern => pattern :: PatternPLayer (single pattern!)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
// start sound
{ LPF.ar(LFSaw.ar(\freq.kr(440)), LFNoise2.kr(1).range(300, 2000)) } => \sound;
// play pattern 1 into frequency
Prand([50, 51.5, 53, 53.8, 57].midicps, inf) => Pfunc({ 0.01 exprand: 1.5 }) => ~freq;
#+END_EXAMPLE

** PatternPlayer =>

A pattern player when sent to a MultiControl plays in a single argument of a SynthTree (not a pattern array to create events in a SynthTree).

- PatternPlayer => MultiControl :: play / PatternFunc

Example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
// start sound
{ SinOsc.ar(\freq.kr(440) )} => \sound;
// play pattern 1 into frequency
Prand([60, 62, 63, 64, 67].midicps, inf) => 0.1 => ~freq;
// replace with pattern 2 into frequency
Prand([60, 61, 66, 67].midicps, inf) => [0.05, 0.1, 0.4].prand(inf) => ~freq;
#+END_EXAMPLE

Some pattern variants to try out:

*** ! { LPF.ar(LFPulse.ar(\freq.kr(440)), 500) } => \sound;

*** 1 "Upward motif"
Pstutter(2, Prand([60, 62, 63, 64, 67], inf)).midicps
 * Pstutter(12, Pseq([1, 2/3, 3/4, 8/9, 4/3], inf))
 * [1, 9/8].pseq(inf)
 => [0.1 pn: 12, 0.4, 0.2 pn: 2].prand(inf)
 => ~freq;
*** 2 "Downward motif"
Pstutter(2, Prand([60, 62, 63, 64, 67], inf)).midicps
 * Pstutter(12, Pseq([1, 2/3, 3/4, 8/9, 4/3], inf))
 * [1, 8/9].pseq(inf)
 => [0.1 pn: 12, 0.4, 0.2 pn: 2].prand(inf)
 => ~freq
*** 3 "Triplet motif"
Pstutter(3, Prand([60, 62, 63, 64, 67], inf)).midicps
 * Pstutter(12, Pseq([1, 2/3, 3/4, 8/9, 4/3], inf))
 * [1, 8/9, 9/8].pseq(inf)
 => [0.1 pn: 24, 0.4, 0.2 pn: 2].prand(inf)
 => ~freq
*** 4 "Triplet major triad motif"
Pstutter(2, Prand([60, 62, 63, 64, 67], inf)).midicps
 * Pstutter(12, Pseq([1, 2/3, 3/4, 8/9, 4/3], inf))
 * [1, 4/5, 3/2].pseq(inf)
 => [0.1 pn: 12, 0.4, 0.2 pn: 2].prand(inf)
 => ~freq
*** 5 Occasional trills
Pstutter(3, Prand([60, 62, 63, 64, 67], inf)).midicps
 * Pstutter(12, Pseq([1, 2/3, 3/4, 8/9, 4/3], inf))
 * [[1, 9/8].pseq(24), [1, 8/9].pseq(24)].prand(inf)
 => [0.1 pn: 6, [0.05 pn: 6, 0.3 pn: 2].pseq].prand(inf)
 => ~freq
