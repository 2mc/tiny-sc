Some very small and few utilities for SuperCollider started in Feb 2014 â€” Edit

* Done:

- Adsr, Sine, Perc: Env shortcuts
- out: Out.ar/kr shortcut.

* Plans:

- Add Notification class and Object methods for it (from previous libs).
- Add sclang-snippets.el for Emacs (from own emacs repo).
- Add to sclang-snippets:
  - Each snippet eval output is stored in list of objects, in emacs buffer,
    for access, eg. to free or pause a synth, routine, group, pattern player etc.
  - If return value is synth: store synth
  - If return value is routine: create own group for putting synths in,
    so that synths are also freed when routine is stopped?
    Possible?  Only via currentEnvironment.  Use variant of Synth.new
    to access currentEnvironment's target?
    This could be method synth of string or symbol, called in similar manner as Synth.new:
    Instead of Synth("test"), write synth("test").
  - Similar to routine, also for Pbinds.
    Check if Pbind accesses currentEnvironment to get \target value.
    If so, then implementing private group per snippet should be easy.
